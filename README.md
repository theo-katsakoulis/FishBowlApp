Salad Bowl is a Team-Play game in which teams take turns guessing words with increasing levels of difficulty.

Salad Bowl is a fast-paced word-guessing party game meant for teams. On each team's turn, one person (the 'actor') is assigned a series of
words and tries to get their partner (the 'guesser') to guess as many words as they can in the selected time. The game has three rounds,
each of which have their own rules. This Android app is meant to be passed around during the game, and will make the game flow 
significantly more quickly and smoothly. Users first select a number of teams and letter categories to generate the game word list from or 
they can even write their own words. When guessers successfully guess a word, the actor can go to the next word. After three rounds, 
points are added up and a winner is crowned!
